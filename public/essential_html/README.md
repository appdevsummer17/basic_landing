# Essential HTML

## Tasks

Read through `details.html`, `index.html`, and `new.html` and try to make sense of them. Open them in Chrome and play with them. Click on things. Experiment.

All the other HTML and CSS and Bootstrap and everything else we're going to learn about are fun and empowering, but the contents of this repo are all you **need** to know about HTML in order to move forward.

Now's your chance to ask questions! Ask a question about anything at all that seems fuzzy.
